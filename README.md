## üöÄ Deploy Step-by-Step Tutorial
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) will be your hosting server for the static files.

### Step 1: Login to AWS Console
  Open AWS Console and sign in.
  

### Step 2: Navigate to S3
  Search for S3 in the top search bar and click on it.

        
### Step 3: 1.Create an S3 Bucket

   Bucket name should be globally unique
   Uncheck ‚ÄúBlock all public access‚Äù
   Leave other settings as default
    Click Create bucket!

2.Upload your site files:

Open the newly created bucket
Click Upload, drag in your index.html, CSS, JS, and image files
Click Upload.

### Step 4: Enable Static Website Hosting:

1.Go to Properties Tab: In your bucket, click Properties

2.Scroll to Static website hosting

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 022102](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8234df7a-90d2-44fb-b557-1c4945381039)

3.Click Edit > Select Enable

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 022323](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f356d144-35b2-4bd9-b298-68a3dfb620d8)

4.Set Document Names:
Index document: index.html
Error document: (optional) error.html

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 022402](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/971be4d0-2d22-4eed-8d6b-41dc89aa1343)

5.Save Changes
You‚Äôll now see an Endpoint URL ‚Äî this is your temporary website URL hosted via S3.



### Step 5: Make Your Bucket Public (with Caution)

1.To allow visitors to access your site, you must make the files publicly readable.

2.Go to the Permissions tab in your bucket.

3.Scroll to Bucket Policy > Click Edit

4.Paste the following policy (replace yourdomain.com with your actual bucket name):

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::yourdomain.com/*"
    }
  ]
}

This policy will grant public read access to all objects within the "awscloudfriends" S3 bucket.

You can see your website, but it is not your custome domain url

### Step 6: Add HTTPS with CloudFront & ACM :

To make your site secure (HTTPS), you‚Äôll use Amazon CloudFront (CDN) and ACM (SSL Certificates).

‚úÖ Request an SSL Certificate with ACM-

1.Go to Certificate Manager (ACM) in AWS

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 024604](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5d7ef51-fe50-4598-a3d0-6bf059de4e84)

2.Click Request a certificate > Select Public certificate

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 024652](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe8bdf56-87d2-4dfa-a490-4842bd8af101)

3.Add your domain (e.g., yourdomain.com, and *.yourdomain.com for subdomains)

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 025012](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5c3ee02-5565-47d5-b97e-671b1307a769)

4.Choose DNS validation

5.Add the provided DNS records where your domain is registered

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 025103](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/523d46f8-4a69-422a-899d-c9e5893366b4)

6.Wait for status to turn to "Issued".



### üåç Create a CloudFront Distribution

1.Go to CloudFront

2.Click Create distribution

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 030335](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d58e38-22c2-47c2-8a4f-a51134a8812a)

3.Origin Domain: Paste your S3 static website endpoint (not the bucket name)

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 030508](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d31c7c1f-956d-478c-adbe-b948a728943e)

4.Set: Viewer protocol policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 030723](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f6b0205-9ef4-416f-b135-3303b1b20755)

5.Alternate domain names if had any: Add yourdomain.com, www.yourdomain.com

6.Select the ACM certificate you created
Default root object: index.html

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 030829](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86a08b3d-a422-4b94-8182-3455d83bc999)

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 031613](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec5e322d-bec3-4171-920c-b526031b9177)

7.Enable security option if you want extra protection from common web attacks like SQL injections, XSS, etc.
Best for public websites or anything exposed on the internet (even static ones).

You‚Äôll be able to select or create a Web ACL (Access Control List) after this step.

8.Click Create distribution

9.Wait for status to turn Deployed

10.Make a note of your CloudFront URL (e.g., d123abcxyz.cloudfront.net)



### Step 7: Configure DNS for Your Domain(I‚Äôm ignoring this step)

1.If you have a custom domain (like yourdomain.com), it‚Äôs time to connect it.

2.Log in to your DNS provider (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap)

3.Add a CNAME Record:
Name: www (or blank for root domain)
Value: CloudFront domain name (d123abcxyz.cloudfront.net)

4.For root domains (without www), use an ALIAS or ANAME record if supported (or use AWS Route 53)

Now, accessing yourdomain.com or www.yourdomain.com should take you to your static website üîó



### Step 8: Add Basic Security with AWS WAF

Protect your site from common attacks using AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall).

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 033411](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3a00d17-4784-4ac5-a0eb-5090636e5ca2)

1.Go to the AWS WAF & Shield Console

2.Click Create web ACL

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 034500](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b18a4655-9048-488b-96c7-624608ae1034)

3.Give it a name (my-website-acl)
Region: Select us-east-1 (same as CloudFront) or Global

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 034547](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8752107-3e5e-42e2-8e10-44e01ca0be55)

4.Resource type: CloudFront distribution
5.Select your distribution

6.Add Managed Rule Groups
Example: AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet (blocks SQLi, XSS, etc.)

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 035016](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb60642-47ec-4d29-8ec1-55dadc53874c)

(Optional) Add Custom Rules (like IP blocking)

7.Default Action: Allow

8.Click Create web ACL

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 035401](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c03b163-007c-4fb3-91d9-c07f084091f1)

Your CloudFront distribution is now protected by WAF! üõ°

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 035625](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f963bec6-729f-4d30-a403-77367474709e)



### Step 9: Monitor Your Website with CloudWatch

1.Navigate to Amazon CloudWatch

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 040301](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50e85498-90ea-4110-bc56-6239896a2806)

2.Explore metrics under:
S3 for data usage

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 041406](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ba4e041-2695-4711-843c-81aa80aedb76)
![Screenshot 2025-04-12 041450](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e86c384-8cf9-40d4-8272-91e5f94ae6b4)

CloudFront for request rates, errors, latency

![Screenshot 2025-04-12 041639](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9be0de9c-f1b4-4530-bdc3-0a1fa700936a)

3.Set up Alarms to be notified of:
High error rates
Spikes in traffic

This helps keep your site healthy and performance.
